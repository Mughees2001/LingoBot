# LingoBot: The Urdu Language Learning Platform

## Overview

LingoBot is a dynamic language learning platform, initially designed to aid in learning Urdu, a language considered underrepresented in technology. Our platform leverages generative AI to provide an interactive and engaging learning experience, and it can easily be adapted to other languages as well.

LingoBot also includes a versatile voice chatbot with the following functionalities:
1. **General Conversational AI:** Engage in day-to-day conversations in Urdu.
